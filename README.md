###Requirements:

+ Unreal Engine 4.10+
+ Android 9+
+ iOS 8.0+

## Unreal Engine Integration

### Plugin Files

Place files from archive to your projects `plugin` folder. It must look like `<project_folder>/Plugins/Appodeal/`.
Then run `<project_name>.uproject` file, it will ask you to build binnaries for Appodeal Plugin, press yes.

If you have any problem with buildig, try to remove `Intermediate` and `Binaries` folders from your project folder.

### Unreal Engine Project Configuration

Now you'll need to configure your project. 

#### Android: 

Open `File-> Package Project -> Packaging Settings...` and open `Android` in `Platforms` section.

Then check settings there:

+ Minimum SDK Version should be at least 9. 
+ Target SDK is better to set 24 or above.
+ Android Package Name should be the same as you've set in Appodeal when created app.
+ Add Extra Permissions: 
    + android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE
    + android.permission.INTERNET
+ Optional Extra Permissions for better earnings:
    + android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION
    + android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
    + android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE
+ Google Play Services should be enabled, because Appodeal requires it.

If you see toast message "AdMob not found" in your game and you use Unreal Engine 4.18, you should edit the following file: Plugins/Appodeal/Source/Appodeal/Appodeal_APL.xml

Scroll to line 13 (<AARImports>) ad add the following lines:

```
<insertValue value="com.google.android.gms,play-services-ads,11.0.4"/>
<insertNewline/>
<insertValue value="com.google.android.gms,play-services-ads-lite,11.0.4"/>
<insertNewline/>
```

Check Android SDK settings, Android SDK, NDK and ANT shoud be configured.

Appodeal plugin depends on [MultiDex](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/multidex) plugin. Without this plugin you probably won't be able to build your game for Android. Please read installation guide carefully.

If youâ€™ve encountered the java.lang.OutOfMemoryError it means the java virtual machine has not enough memory to build the code. To increase it set up the environment variable _JAVA_OPTIONS with the value -Xmx1024m -Xms256m -Xss8m.

You might need to increase the -Xmx value to something between 1024m and 2048m.

#### iOS:

Open `File-> Package Project -> Packaging Settings...` and open `iOS` in `Platforms` section.

+ Go to the build settings and set one Additional Linker Flag: `-ObjC`

### Code Integration

#### Ad Types

You can use following ad types:
+ Interstitial
+ Banner
+ Rewarded Video
+ Non Skippable Video
Most of Appodeal Blueprint methods are asking which ones you want to use.

#### Initialization

Please add Appodeal Component somewhere on your actor, to be able to access Events. Also Appodeal Component allows you to configure initialization, auto cache, and some additional parameters without calling functions in buleprint.

All Appodeal actions is under `Actions -> Advertising -> Appodeal`

To Initialize Appodeal SDK, add InitializeWithParameters action somewhere on the app start (best place to do that is on `BeginPlay Event` in starting Scene) then configure app keys (you can find it in App settings in Appodeal dashboard) and check ad types you want to initialize.

Alternatively, if you have added Appodeal component, you can configure parameters of the Appodeal plugin in `Details` tab of the component.

After that just add Initialize action with Appodeal component as a target. All settings will be applied automatically.

#### Display ad

To show ads use Show action where you want and check ad types you want see.

#### Hiding banner

To hide banner use Hide Banner action.
